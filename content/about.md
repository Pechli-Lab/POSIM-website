title: About POSIM

Each year in Ontario about 400 new pediatric cancer cases are diagnosed. Clinicians, scientists, and policy makers face difficult decisions on what is the most effective and affordable way to manage and screen for these cancers. Decision analytic models that can inform such important decisions through the combined use of decision theory and mathematical simulation modeling are useful for this purpose. However, such decision models are often embedded in programming software which make them difficult to access and use. The challenge is making pediatric cancer models public and easily usable. The POSIM team accepted this challenge on your behalf.

The Pediatric Oncology Simulation Model (POSIM) is an online web application that hosts decision analytic models and disease models. POSIM is intended primarily to guide clinical and policy decisions in Ontario and will inevitably be of use to other provinces and will be designed in such a way that is easily expandable to other jurisdictions.
